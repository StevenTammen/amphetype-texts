** About this repository

This repository contains scripts to generate text files to use with the typing program [[https://github.com/webiest/amphetype][Amphetype]]. Currently there is a script for generating practice files based on frequent words, and a script for generating chapters of the Bible in plain text.

** Practice files

Anyone is free to download and tinker with the scripts, but if you just want to get the files to use yourself, you can download them at the links below:

- [[https://github.com/StevenTammen/amphetype-texts/tree/master/frequency-lists][Frequent words]]
- [[https://github.com/StevenTammen/amphetype-texts/tree/master/bible-chapters][Bible chapters]]

I would suggest you download the whole repository as a zip archive (on the [[https://github.com/StevenTammen/amphetype-texts][base page]] click "Clone or download" --> "Download ZIP"). This is much more efficient than downloading files one by one.
